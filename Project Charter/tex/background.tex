	The Smart Hospital is using several websites such as mysignup.com, signupgenius.com, quartz, timeclockwizard.com, and outlook calendar. It is a system to keep track of students clocking in and out, inventory management tracking, simulation schedules, and student hours. This system is currently used by faculty and students to maintain the smart hospital. 
	This project is being undertaken inorder to establish a single web application for the smart hospital. The web application is being created to speed up the everyday proceedings and to better manage the inventory of the smart hospital.
