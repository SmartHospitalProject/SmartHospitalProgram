The facilities and equipment needed for this project are extremely simple. The team will be using the layout of the entire Smart Hospital for references and the scanning system the Smart Hospital already has in place. As for other equipment, the team will use their personal computers with Brackets, Github, Nodejs, and MySQL. All of the items listed will help move the team forward as the project goes underway.
