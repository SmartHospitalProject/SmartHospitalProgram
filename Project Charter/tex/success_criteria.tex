We feel that the project will be successful when the following major functionality is implemented: 
\end{flushleft}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The system or some aspect of our deliverable will allow the smart Hospital Faculty to easily view which workstations are free and which workstations are taken from a calendar view.
	\item The system allows inventory to be checked easily and quickly.
	\item Event notifications and confirmations are correctly sent to the correct faculty or student members.
\end{itemize}
\begin{flushleft}
and these issues are addressed:
\end{flushleft}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The system is easy to learn to use.
	\item Information is easily managed. 
	\item The data is correct and is organized such that interaction between data, such as dates and events, are valid.
\end{itemize}
