The Smart Hospital Management Tool is a deployable website for use in UT Arlington's Smart Hospital. The management tool will be based on a PHP back end with HTML, CSS, and Javascript front ends. The website will be fast and responsive in order to keep up with the demands of a fast paced simulation hospital. Tools within the program will be touch friendly and easy to understand for use on tablet devices throughout the Smart Hospital and future deployment locations.
