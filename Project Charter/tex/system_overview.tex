The Smart Hospital Management Tool is a deployable website for use in UT Arlington's Smart Hospital. The management tool will be based on a node.js back end with HTML, CSS, and Javascript front ends. The website will be fast and responsive in order to keep up with the demands of a fast pased simulation hospital. Tools within the program will be touch friendly and easy to understand for use on tablet devices throughout the Smart Hospital and future deployment locations. Students and instructors will be able to log in using UT Arlington's universal log in. Future document updates will include updated detailed information as the system becomes more clear.
