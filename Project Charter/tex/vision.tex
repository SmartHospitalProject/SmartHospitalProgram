Smart Hospital is a web-based software application which is created to manage the simulated environment in the UT Arlington Smart Hospital facility. The software will help the Smart Hospital client in successfully managing their inventory, employee schedules, time, generated reports, and other factors. There has not been any software in the market where all of these things can be accomplished in a single place. The Smart Hospital Management Tool is valuable to our customer because using multiple applications for a single purpose is a hassle when it can be done with one. This project is valuable to the team because it gives us an opportunity to create a marketable product. The success of this project will allow the team to form a product company. The team will deploy the Smart Hospital Management tool in multiple stages with increasing measures of success at each stage. The team will be successful if the customer and agile expert give positive responses. The second stage will see a Smart Hospital beta available for customer trial. Meeting the customer's needs will produce success in the product. The final stage will finalize work and handover completed software to the customer and open source community.
