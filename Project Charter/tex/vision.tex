Smart Hospital is a web-based software application, which is created to manage the simulated environment in UTA Smart Hospital facility. Our software will help our client successfully manage their inventory, employee's schedule, time, generates reports  and other. There has not been any software in market where all of these things can be accomplished in single place. Smart Hospital software is valuable to our customer because using multiple applications for single purpose is the hassle when it can be done within one. This project is valuable to us because it gives us an opportunity to create a marketable product. The success of this project will allow us to form our own product company and make a good living doing work that we love. We will deploy Smart Hospital in multiple stages with increasing measures of success at each stage. In the first stage, we will demonstrate a proof-of-concept at a major agile event. We will be successful if we attract a positive response from agile expert and our customer. In second stage we will make a smart hospital beta available for our customer’s trial. We will be successful if our product meets the customer’s need. In the third stage, we will finalize our work and handover completed software to the customer and make it an open source for everyone to use when there is a need.
