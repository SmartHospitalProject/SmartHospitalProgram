The Smart Hospital project is a deployable, web based management tool. Costs for the project will focus solely on server and domain costs.

\subsection{Preliminary Budget}
The Preliminary costs will be low. The Smart Hospital project is a software one. Little to no hardware is required at the current stage. As the project moves forward, costs for server services will be researched. A quality shared hosting server for websites can be as low as \$50 per year, some even for free. This will likely be the teams cost for testing and deploying before the management tools are officially released. 

\subsection{Current \& Pending Support}
The current budget for the program is \$800 provided by the senior design class through the use of tuition fees. Pending support will come from UT Arlington and the Smart Hospital stakeholders in the form of long term server and maintenance fees. UT Arlington may be able to provide a server for the Smart Hospital to run on after the product release. Secondary options are still being considered in case UT Arlington cannot provide a server.
